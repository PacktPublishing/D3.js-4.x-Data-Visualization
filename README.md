# D3.js 4.x Data Visualization - Third Edition
This is the code repository for [D3.js 4.x Data Visualization - Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/d3js-4x-data-visualization-third-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787120358), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Welcome to D3.js 4.x Data Visualization, Third Edition. Over the course of this book, you’ll learn the basics of one of the world’s most ubiquitous and powerful data visualization libraries, but we don’t stop there. By the end of our time together, you’ll have all the skills you need to become a total D3 ninja, and will be able to do everything from build visualizations from scratch straight through to using it on the server and writing automated tests. If you haven’t leveled up your JavaScript skills in a while, you’re in for a treat--this book endeavors to use the latest features currently being added to the language, all the while explaining why they’re cool and how they differ from "old school" JavaScript. 
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
"babel": {
  "presets": [
    "es2017"
  ]
},
"main": "lib/main.js",
"scripts": {
  "start": "webpack-dev-server --inline",
},
```

You will need a machine that is capable of running Node.js. We will discuss how to install this in the first chapter--you can run it on pretty much anything, but having a few extra gigabytes of RAM available will probably help you while developing. Some of the mapping examples later in the book are kind of CPU intensive, though most machines produced since 2014 should be able to handle it.
You should also have the latest version of your favorite web browser--mine is Chrome, and I use it in the examples, but Firefox also works well. You can also try to work in Safari or Internet Explorer/Edge, or Opera, or any number of other browsers, but I find Chrome’s developer tools to be the best.
